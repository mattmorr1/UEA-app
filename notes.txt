- abstracting layer for ai agent (langchain?)
- worried about prompting (rate limiting, prompt cap, config in admin?)
- api interchanging?
- how does admin have control over backend? -> no home button back, have to use url
- more efficient way to create accounts?
- organizations?
- add your own prompt/template (cls, other) for ai upload
- make the generation process faster/seem more seamless
- pdf uploads
- upload failed? 
- token cap
    - monetization
    - cost model
- customization with invites
- promote people to admin?
- optimize output for UEA
- batching/agentic until full output generated (rn token cap) -> batching should be more around if it caps out length
- write readme, create notion site for explain use case
- renderer viewer doesnt clear after leaving specific file
- ux is wack
- pdf viewer is odd
- top bar is weird

-> connect to api key?
- What types of uploads does it allow?(is there a spot for specifications that i missed)
- Order of documents?
- Different document icons for different types? at the top there are different icons for the different style formats so i thought that it would be helpful if the icons matched in the document area
